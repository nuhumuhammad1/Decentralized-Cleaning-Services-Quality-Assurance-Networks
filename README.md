# Decentralized Cleaning Services Quality Assurance Network

A blockchain-based quality assurance system for cleaning services built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

This system provides a comprehensive quality assurance framework for cleaning services, including provider verification, quality standards management, inspection coordination, customer feedback collection, and performance measurement.

## Architecture

The system consists of five main smart contracts:

### 1. Service Provider Verification Contract
- **File**: `contracts/service-provider-verification.clar`
- **Purpose**: Manages registration and verification of cleaning service providers
- **Key Features**:
    - Provider registration with license verification
    - Admin-controlled verification process
    - Service certification management
    - Provider status tracking (pending, verified, suspended)

### 2. Quality Standards Contract
- **File**: `contracts/quality-standards.clar`
- **Purpose**: Defines and manages cleaning quality standards and criteria
- **Key Features**:
    - Create and manage quality standards
    - Assign standards to specific service types
    - Weighted scoring system
    - Standard activation/deactivation

### 3. Inspection Coordination Contract
- **File**: `contracts/inspection-coordination.clar`
- **Purpose**: Coordinates quality inspections and manages inspector assignments
- **Key Features**:
    - Inspector registration and certification
    - Inspection scheduling and tracking
    - Real-time inspection status updates
    - Results recording with detailed scoring

### 4. Customer Feedback Contract
- **File**: `contracts/customer-feedback.clar`
- **Purpose**: Collects and manages customer feedback for cleaning services
- **Key Features**:
    - Customer feedback submission
    - Category-specific ratings
    - Feedback verification system
    - Provider rating calculations

### 5. Performance Measurement Contract
- **File**: `contracts/performance-measurement.clar`
- **Purpose**: Measures and tracks service provider performance metrics
- **Key Features**:
    - Performance benchmarking
    - Historical performance tracking
    - Weighted performance scoring
    - Compliance monitoring

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Verification**: No single point of failure for provider verification
- **Transparent Quality Standards**: Publicly accessible quality criteria
- **Automated Inspection Tracking**: Real-time inspection status and results
- **Customer-Driven Feedback**: Direct customer input on service quality
- **Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive performance measurement and tracking
